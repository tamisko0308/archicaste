This work was done in the university of Thessaloniki for the Erasmus programme. The exercises have an analytical character, their aim is research through an experimental procedure. The compositions are made with a variety of tools and materials to take advantage of the differences in their texture and to experiment with all possible ways of elaborating, drawing and presenting an architectural design. The aim is to choose the appropriate media and materials and to experiment on visual organization of surfaces in order to explore the possibilities for presentation of architectural designs.
