This work was done in the university of Thessaloniki for the Erasmus programme. It is divided in two parts, the first is the construction of a volumetric model based on a painting of geometric abstraction made by the artist Kazimir Malevich in 1916 and called Suprematism, suggested by the professor.

The second part is the creation of an image with an architectural space that contains within it the pictures of the model which is imagined as a construction in a space.

To create the digital composition, images downloaded from the internet were used in addition to the photos of the model.
