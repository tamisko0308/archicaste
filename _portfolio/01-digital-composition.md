This work is divided in two parts, the first is the construction of a volumetric model based on a painting of geometric abstraction made by the artist Kazimir Malevich in 1916 and called Suprematism, suggested by the professor.

The second part is the creation of an image with an architectural space that contains within it the pictures of the model, imagined as a construction in a space.

The composition is digitally created, in addition to the specific photos of the model, other images downloaded from the internet were used.
