  text:
    - Hi, I am Tamara Castellano, an Italian architect graduated in the university of Florence, a city that stands out for its unique historical architecture.
    - I am interested in the design of new building but also in the restoration with the purpose of giving new life to existing buildings.
    - My goal is to progressively improve my potential and the skills acquired during university studies.
    - In an architectural project it is important to create a comfortable environment for the people and also take into consideration the context in which the construction will be.
