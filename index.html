  text:
    - Hi, I am Tamara Castellano, graduated in Architecture in Italy at the university of Florence, a city that stands out for its unique historical architecture.
    - I am interested in the design of new building but also in the redevelopment and reuse with the purpose of giving new life to existing architecture.
    - I believe that in an architectural project it is important to create a comfortable environment for the people and also take into consideration the context in which the construction will be, with a look at sustainability.
